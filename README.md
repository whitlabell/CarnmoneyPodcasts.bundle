# CarnmoneyPodcasts.bundle
Plex plugin for Carnmoney Church Podcasts on Podbean
Carnmoney Church is a vibrant fellowship of Christians based in Carnmoney, Newtownabbey Northern Ireland. We publish all of our weekly sermons and talks on the popular Podbean website, and this plugin enables you to quickly and conveniently access those podcasts from within Plex.

Further updates will add more categories and support for videos; work is also ongoing to make the plugin work with any Podbean podcast, not just ours!
