Plex plugin for Carnmoney Church Podcasts on Podbean
Carnmoney Church is a vibrant fellowship of Christians based in Carnmoney, Newtownabbey Northern Ireland. We publish all of our weekly sermons and talks on the popular Podbean website, and this plugin enables you to quickly and conveniently access those podcasts from within Plex.

Further updates will add more features and improve performance of searches (although it's perectly usable now). We also plan a video and picture channel as well.
